Listen here you little shit!"

He lashed out with his left leg and hit the horse square in the ribs.

The horse reared up and fell to the ground, the reins slipping from the young man's hand.

He scrambled to his feet, his big fat balls dangling between his legs and roared in anger and frustration, screaming, "You know I'll kill you!"

He grabbed the reins again and tried to get the horse to move, but it reared up again and knocked him out of the saddle.

As he fell, the reins ripped out of his hands.

The horse started to run.

A German officer, seeing the fight, came over to them.

"That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.

and then the horse goes crazy!

We thought it was drunk!"

He drew his sword and chased the horse down.

He jumped onto the horse's back and tried to calm it down, slapping it in the face.

The horse reared up and pulled the German off, kicking and biting at him.

He was badly hurt and was forced to get off.

When he fell, the horse stamped over him.

The End
